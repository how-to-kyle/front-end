## Objectives Front End 2:

React Application:
  MVP:
  - [] React app deployed
  - [] Landing page incorporated in app
  Stretch: 
  - [] Continuous deployment is set up in a manner that is conducive to a team project environment
  - [] Project is organized well on GitHub.
  - [] Extra considerations were made to help all team members understand how to contribute easily to the project no matter their role (Include instructions in ReadMe)

HTTP/AJAX: 
  MVP:
  - [] CRUD operations drive the application. 
  - [] Each participating student individually created pages that complete all CRUD operations. 
  - [] Token authentication is handled correctly.
  Stretch: 
  - [] Pages making HTTP requests do so in a logical manner that is cohesive with the app's state management system. 
  - [] Student showed great care and insight when handling token authentication. 
  - [] Student used a modular stystem for all requests (e.g. useFetch custom hook)

State Management:
  MVP:
  - [] Student has implemented a state management system that makes sense for the project.
  - [] It is organized well and implemented correctly.
  - [] State is not lost as user goes through the application.
  Stretch:
  - [] Student showed the ability to manage state in a very coherent system at all levels of the app - global state management, component tree state management, and individual component management. 
  - [] The system is easy to understand and use. 
  - [] Student may have also designed it in such a way that it is reusable for a lot of the state management needs of the app.
